## What's that repo?

This is a personal reposity where I gather knowledge I'd like to review on a regular basis.

My main goal is to constantly learn more advanced knowledge in order to become a senior web developer as soon as possible and to constantly reach a higher level of expertise in a wide range of subjects.
